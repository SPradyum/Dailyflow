## 🧠 How Auto-Planning Works

Each task receives a smart score based on:

• Priority level
• Due date proximity
• Duration

Tasks with highest score appear earlier in the plan.
---
## Example:

1. Critical + due today → Top position
2. Medium + due next week → Later slot
3. Long tasks → spaced with breaks
